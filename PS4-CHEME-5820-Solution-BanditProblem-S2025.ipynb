    "# PS4: Let's build a Personal Shopper\n",
    "In this problem set, we'll build a simple personal shopper agent that helps users (the world) find items they might want to buy based on their preferences. The agent allows users to encode their sentiments and then suggests combinations of items that maximize user satisfaction (measured using a utility function), subject to a budget constraint.\n",
    "* _How will we do this?_ We will use a greedy bandit problem algorithm to find the best item combination that maximizes user satisfaction without exceeding their budget. The teaching team modified the `L7b` codebase to address choices of combinations and provided a budget-aware `world(...)` function (definition below).\n",
    "* _Multiple choices_: The bandit problems in `Week 7` estimated the best _single choice_ among $K$ competing alternatives (arms). In this case, shoppers can choose multiple items from a list of $K$ items simultaneously. Thus, we have $N = 2^{K}$ possible combinations. We address this by recommending action vectors $\\mathbf{a}\\in \\{0,1 \\}^{N}$, where $a_i = 1$ indicates choice and $a_i = 0$ indicates non-choice. We compute the reward of each action vector during our reasoning process.\n",
    "* _Budget constraint_: The bandit algorithm will also need to respect a budget constraint, which means that the total cost of the chosen items cannot exceed a specified budget. This is done by modifying the `world(...)` function with [a quadratic penalty term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_function) that is _subtracted_ from the utility if the total cost of the chosen items exceeds the budget. The penalty term reflects the difference between total cost and budget, discouraging choices that exceed the budget. The bandit's sensitivity to this constraint is indicated by the hyperparameter $\\lambda\\geq 0$. If $\\lambda = 0$, the bandit ignores the budget and maximizes utility. If $\\lambda>0$, the bandit seeks to maximize utility while adhering to the budget. A larger $\\lambda$ indicates greater sensitivity to the budget constraint.\n",

    "### Tasks\n",
    "Before you start, execute the `Run All Cells` command to check if you have any code or setup issues. Code issues, post them [to Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/) - and let's get those fixed!\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Task 1: Setup, Data, Constants__: In this task, we set up the computational environment, load the necessary packages, and prepare the `world(...)` function for our personal shopper problem. We will also define any constants we use throughout the problem set.\n",
    "* __Task 2: Build the Context Models__:In this task, we will build several models of the contextual information used to inform the agent's recommendations. These models, which are [instances of the `MyBanditConsumerContextModel` type](src/Types.jl), hold various parameters that will be used in the `world(...)` function that we developed in Task 1.\n",
    "* __Task 3: Evaluation of Scenarios__: In this task, we'll run different context models to evaluate how well our agent performs under various scenarios. We will use the same bandit algorithm in all cases but vary the context model to see how it influences the agent's decisions and performance. We display the results, and ask you a few discussion questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests throughout the notebook (and at the bottom section) help you determine if things are running correctly. Let's go! (Remember to answer the discussion questions.)"

    "Next, let's build a model of our agent's decision-making process.  We've modified the $\\epsilon$-greedy algorithm from `L7b` to work with our contextual multiple-choice bandit problem. The algorithm will now consider the context provided by [the `MyBanditConsumerContextModel` model](src/Types.jl) and can select multiple items from the list of possible choices.\n",

    "In the _epsilon-greedy_ algorithm, the agent chooses the best _single_ arm with probability $1-\\epsilon$ and a random arm with probability $\\epsilon$. This approach balances exploration and exploitation by allowing the agent to explore different arms while exploiting the best-known arm based on past rewards. The parameter $\\epsilon$ controls the exploration rate: a higher value means more exploration, while a lower value means more exploitation.\n",

Thus, each arm corresponds to a unique combination of items, with the total number of arms being $N = 2^{K}$, where $K$ is the number of items available. The binary vector $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N)$ encodes the combination of items chosen (1) or not (0). \n",

    "Based on the epsilon-greedy strategy, the agent will decide which arm to pull (a combination of items) during each round. The agent maintains a list of average rewards for each arm (combination of items) and updates these values based on the rewards received from the adversary (nature) over $T$ rounds. The algorithm works as follows:\n",

    "__Intialization__: Specify the `world(...)` method, a `context` model, and the set of possible actions $\\mathcal{A} = \\left\\{1,2,\\dots, N\\right\\}$ where $N = 2^{K}$, and $K$ denotes the number of items available for selection. \n",

    "Execute the action $a_{t}$, i.e., evaluate the `world(...)` method, and receive a reward $r_{t}$ from the _adversary_ (nature). \n",

    "4. Update average reward data for $a_{t}\\in\\mathcal{A}$. We used a moving average for the rewards of each action $a_i$: $\\mu_{a,t} = \\mu_{a,t-1} + \\alpha\\left(r_{t} - \\mu_{a,t-1}\\right)$, where $\\alpha>0$ is a learning rate hyperparameter.
